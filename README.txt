Learning React:

	I decided to learn React because I have heard a lot about it but never used it.
I have mainly been programming in C++ for past projects, so it will be nice to not have
to deal with pointers, lol.
	The tutorial I did is about programming a game of tic tac toe with React. The game
also recordeds past moves and displays them to the user with a simple interface.  I used a
website called codepen.io to program the game in my browser.  At first I found the platform
to be unique in its format.  I took me quite awhile to pick up on the nuances of the language.
I thought the tutorial did a good job in explaining how to program the game.  But, sicne it was
my first ever working with React most of the challenges for me came from trying to understand the 
fundamentals like, syntax, data types and proper initialization.  Once I got that down I felt 
more confident in my approach to the tutorial and handled it well.
